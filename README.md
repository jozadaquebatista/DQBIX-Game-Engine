  - Shaders
  - TrueType text

HELP NEEDED (For the new engine [NIX])
-------------------------------------
Since this is not perfect, here's a todo list. I really want some help!
  - Add normal map support
  - Build a SceneTree system (I'm already doing it, but I accept any help)
  - Particle systems
  - Optimizations
  - Android support ( OpenGL ES 2.0 )
  - Lighting

PS: I accept suggestions!
  
If you want to help me, you'll need QtCreator ( Windows Only =( ) with VS 2013 compiler. You can port to other compilers if you want!
