Features
-------------------------------------
  - Render to texture
  - Sprite animation
  - Tile maps
  - Shaders
  - Support for multiple image and audio formats
  - Basic collision detection

PS: Lighting and Shadows are disabled, they won't work with the current workflow.

HELP NEEDED
-------------------------------------
Since this is not perfect, here's a todo list. I really want some help!
  - Move everything from glMultiMatrix and glBegins/glEnds to shaders and vertex buffers [DONE!]
  - Code organization/refactoring
  - Rewrite 2D Lighting and Shadows.
  - Improve shader support [DONE!]
  - Add a physics engine (Box2D, Chipmunk or whatever...)
  - Particle systems
  - More advanced collision detection
  - A way to export your game for Windows and Android
  PS: I accept suggestions!
  
If you want to help me, you'll need Visual Studio 2013!
