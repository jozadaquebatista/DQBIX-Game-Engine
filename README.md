## DQBIX-Game-Engine
DQBIX is an easy and advanced 2D game engine made with C++ and using Lua scripting.
See: [Wiki](https://github.com/DCubix/DQBIX-Game-Engine/wiki)

The old version is a (total) mess. I was trying to create something like EGSL (egsl.retrogamecoding.org). But then at some point I couldn't do anything better with that messy code. Then I decided to redesign the entire engine.
Note that the only release is the old versison of the engine. You can make games with it, but I don't guarantee anything...
( The wiki is about the old version as well! )

## Engine Redesign Project
Progress: [ 75% ].

HELP NEEDED (For the new engine [NIX])
-------------------------------------
Since this is not perfect, here's a todo list. I really want some help!
  - Fix SceneTree bugs ( you can parent 1 node to another, but you can't parent a node to a child node... )
  - Particle systems
  - Optimize! Yay!
  - Android support ( OpenGL ES 2.0 )
  - ?????
  
If you want to help me, you'll need QtCreator ( Windows Only =( ) with VS 2013 compiler. You can port to other compilers if you want!
