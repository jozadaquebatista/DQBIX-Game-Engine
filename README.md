## Engine Redesign Project
Goal: Re-Design the entire engine. [ 55% ]

Features (Old Engine)
-------------------------------------
  - Render to texture
  - Sprite animation
  - Tile maps
  - Shaders
  - Support for multiple image and audio formats
  - Basic collision detection

HELP NEEDED (For the new engine [NIX])
-------------------------------------
Since this is not perfect, here's a todo list. I really want some help!
  - Add normal map support
  - Build a SceneTree system (I'm already doing it, but I accept any help)
  - 3D Graphics (I already have a mesh class, all you need to do is implement a model importer (Assimp?) and set a Perspective projection)
  - Lighting

PS: I accept suggestions!
  
If you want to help me, you'll need Visual Studio 2013!
