Features
-------------------------------------
  - Render to texture
  - 2D Lighting and Shadows (it's hacky, but it works :D)
  - Sprite animation
  - Tile maps
  - Shaders
  - Support for multiple image and audio formats
  - Basic collision detection

HÃ„LP!
-------------------------------------
Since this is not perfect, here's a todo list. I really want some help!
  - Improve shader support
  - Move everything from glMultiMatrix and glBegins/glEnds to shaders and vertex buffers
  - Code organization/refactoring
  - Improve 2D Lighting and Shadows
  - Improve shader support (currently it's very hacky) [DONE!]
  - Add more occluder types (currently we only have box. maybe a circle, or polygon occluders...)
  - Add a physics engine (Box2D, Chipmunk or whatever...)
  - Particle systems
  - More advanced collision detection
  - A way to export your game for Windows and Android
  - uhmm... any suggestions?
  
If you want to help me, you'll need Visual Studio 2013 and a lot of coffee!
